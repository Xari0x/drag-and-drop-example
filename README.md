# `Drag & Drop Hotbar example`

![screenshot|1090x232](https://github.com/Xari0x/drag-and-drop-example/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Drag & Drop Hotbar example` is an example that can be used as a basis for other projects. It uses `jQuery UI v1.14.1 & jQuery v3.7.1` as a local file.

This project was created on a personal basis for another inventory project on FiveM. You can move items into a hotbar, specifying the quantity or not, and then retrieve the data in the back-end you want (not present here).

> [!IMPORTANT]
>The top part with the various “Rename” and “Use” buttons, as well as the clothes, is not functional on the demo, as it was made for the FiveM project, but it's easy enough to make it work the way you want.

## USAGE

1. Clone the project on your local computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xari0x/drag-and-drop-hotbar-example.git
```
2. Modify `script.js`, `style.scss` and `index.html` as required, depending on the use case.
3. Compile the **SCSS** style file.

```
4. Open `index.html` and admire the result.
